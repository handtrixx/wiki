If you went successfully through Vercel's free and amazing <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app" target="_blank">Learn Next.js</a> online course, 
you have end up in a nice and "fast" (the database access is actually slow, 
but that was on purpose for better understanding of the tutorial) Demo of a 
modern web application. You have also learned about plenty considerations 
when developing an web app. So now, you maybe feel like "How can I use all of this 
for a real project?". Also there are still some constraints left like; 
"How can I get independent from Vercel's nice but (in their free plan) slow hosting offer?".

My tutorial here is supposed to be an extension to the course but you can also use it, 
since I <a href="https://github.com/handtrixx/nextjs-dashboard" target="_blank">share my code on Github</a>, without going through Vercel's course. 
At first we will "dockerize" our development area, then host our own database 
to finally be able to push all of that to a webserver of our choice.

## Starting Point

At first let's have a look how our setup looks like after we finished chapter 17 of the tutorial:

![Basic Structure](/assets/programming/nextjs-chapter-18/02_struct.png)

You have a local directory "nextjs-dashboard" somewhere on your local machine, 
where you can edit your code with your favorite IDE (I would recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>) 
and look at the result localy on your browser, 
because you also installed node.js on your client. Additionally, just like a professional, 
you commit your code to an GIT instance which is Microsoft's popular GitHub in our case. 
Beside that you learned how to setup and configure Vercel's offer of a database instance 
as well as a public webserver.

That already reveals some flaws and pain (at least in my stomach):
- You had to install node.js on your client and working with files directly part of your local file system
- node.js compiles everything depending on your clients architecture, but your production server most likely (will) run(s) on Linux.
- You have to rely on Vercel's deployment and recompiling for production, which is not 100% transparent (at least to me).  
- The database is reachable from the public internet (even if secured a bit)
- You literally use the same database for development and production purposes, which totally is not how it should be in a real-life example.

Summarized: The setup is not like it would be, if you are a (semi-)professional developer.

That was totally on purpose to keep the "Learn Next.js" tutorial as simple as possible, but will be changed by us, now.

## Docker Containers?!

While in former articles I already wrote about the benefits of the Docker 
container infrastructure from the view of an administrator, 
it also brings big advantages for software developers. 
Even or especially large software companies rely on container architecture 
for software development, they just do not use Docker but Kubernetes which was 
designed by Google for running in big datacenters. Nevertheless, 
Docker provides most of the functionalities similar to Kubernetes and is absolutly 
fine for private developers as well as small(er) companies.

## Install Docker on your PC

To install docker you can follow the well described tutorials on their website: 
https://www.docker.com/get-started/ . I recommend you to install the Docker Desktop 
App in case you are using Windows or Mac OS. 
In case you are using Linux i find it easier and much more leightweigth 
to install Docker via commandline, the same as you would do on a server. 
Once you have successfully installed Docker and the engine is running, it 
is time for the next steps.

## Dockerize your Deveopment Area

In case you want to skip the <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app" target="_blank">Learn Next.js</a> online course or you do not have 
the resources of the result available, you can clone my Repository by 
```git clone https://github.com/handtrixx/nextjs-dashboard.git``` or by the GitHub Desktop App.

![Basic Structure](/assets/programming/nextjs-chapter-18/03_dev.png)

Then in your project's root directory you create/enter folder "docker".
In folder docker we create/enter a subfolder called "dev".

Inside the folder "dev" you create file ".env":

```bash
POSTGRES_URL="xxx"
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="xxx"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="xxx"
POSTGRES_USER="xxx"
POSTGRES_HOST="xxx"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="xxx"
POSTGRES_DATABASE="xxx"

AUTH_SECRET=xxx
```

Please replace xxx by the values of your postgres database from Vercel. 
In case you don't have one or do not want one leave the content like described here, 
just remember when you startup the app it will not be completly functional then, 
since there is no database connection.

Then inside the folder "dev" you create or open the file "Dockerfile" with following content:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a base image
FROM node:latest

# Update OS mostly to enjoy latest security updates
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY --chown=node:node ../../. .

# update npm package manager if required
RUN npm install -g npm

# Copy the startup script to the container
COPY --chown=node:node app-startup.sh /usr/src/app/app-startup.sh

# Give execute permissions to the script
RUN chmod +x /usr/src/app/app-startup.sh

# set user to node
USER node

# Expose the port your app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the startup command
CMD ["sh","/usr/src/app/app-startup.sh"]
```

What did we just do? At first the "Dockerfile" pulls the official node.js 
repository from the Docker Hub repository for further use. Then it installs the 
latest security and functional updates into our container. 
Then it copies the content of our projects directory into directory /usr/src/app 
inside the container. By "RUN npm install -g npm" the newest version of npm is installed. 
Then our startup script is copied and the user used inside the container for all of 
that is changed to "node" to reduce security flaws. At the end the file exposes 
our development port 3000 and instructs the system to start our startup script everytime 
the container will be launched.

The next step is to open/create the file "docker-compose.yml" in the same directory with following content:

```yaml
services:
  nextjs-dashboard:
    build: .
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ../../:/usr/src/app/
      - ./app-startup.sh:/usr/src/app/app-startup.sh
    networks:
      - default
    env_file:
      - .env
```

Docker compose helps us to build up a real dev environment and later to additionally 
add a database server. For the time being the file contains the info to 
use the Dockerfile in the same directory to build our "nextjs-dashboard" service, 
exposes port 3000 to the host and would restart the service in case it 
crashed without manual intervention. On top of that, by the "volumes" are 
we specify that our complete project directory on the host is mapped inside the 
container at /user/src/app and does the same for our startup script. By defining 
network "default" it will create a encapsuled virtual network for the service as 
another layer of security. The last step by providing "env_file" is to forward 
the content ouf our ".env" file in the same directory as environment 
variables into the container.

We are nearly done, the last step is to open/create file app-startup.sh again in the same folder with following content:
```bash
echo Installing node modules from package.json
npm install --no-progress
npm install next@latest --no-progress
echo Starting your Node.js application
npm run dev 

# Keep the script running in case of errors to be able to inspect the container
tail -f /dev/null
```

The script runs every time you will startup the dev container and installs any 
missing node modules before starting the webserver. 
That's it your file structure should now look like this:

![File Structure](/assets/programming/nextjs-chapter-18/04_devfiles.png)

## Container Operations

While you can still use git like before to push your code to Github you have several 
other options to control your container. If you are inside your /dev folder, 
with 
```bash
docker compose up -d
``` 
your container will be build and strated for the first time. 
Any time you make changes of the docker-compose.yml file the same command will refresh 
and restart the configuration.

The command 
```bash 
docker compose down 
``` 
will shutdown your whole environment. While with
```bash 
docker compose logs 
``` 
the log output including the console.log will be shown. 
And if you are not sure if you container is running or not you can test this with command:
```bash
docker compose ps
``` 

In case you want to change/update your Dockerfile, after saving you have to run:
```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
to make these changes active.

## Summary

In this tutorial you successfully "dockerized" your development area, 
but maybe can't already see big advantages beside that you do not have to install 
node.js and keep it up to date. 
That will change during the next tutorials when wie first add a 
database service to become independent from Vercels database instance, 
to divide dev and prd data and to increase security.
